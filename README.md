# Task-Tracker

It is a todo list app where you can create your account and add/delete/complete tasks. I have used nestJs as Backend and VueJs as Frontend.

The Website is deployed on the URL :- https://task-tracker-cqbrtmmd5-vermarahul11300-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/
## Installation :-

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Rahulv1130/Task_Tracker.git
```

Then, you need to install Dependencies :
```
cd backend
```
```
npm install
```
```
cd ../frontend
```
```
npm install
```

Now, replace the .env.example files with .env files, and change the variable values accordingly.

To run the Server, cd in the backend folder and type :
```
npm run start:dev
```

To run the website, cd in frontend folder and type: :
```
npm run serve
```
